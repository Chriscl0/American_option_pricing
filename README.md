# American_option_pricing
This bachelor project aims to determine the price of American options using LSM (Least Squares Monte Carlo), Delta LSM, and neural networks (NN).

The project incorporates the methodologies from the Black-Scholes framework. In the first part of the project, we assume the underlying asset follows a geometric Brownian motion (GBM).Subsequently, we extend these methodologies to the Heston model, which incorporates stochastic volatility.

To run the code, it is recommended to execute it in smaller parts, as calculating all the results at once may be too complex for the computer.

The main document contains all the code used to create the figures and tables in our project. It utilizes all the classes defined in the utils folder.
